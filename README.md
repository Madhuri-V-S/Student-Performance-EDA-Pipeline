# Project Title: Student-Performance-EDA-Pipeline
A modular Python pipeline for loading, analyzing, and visualizing student academic datasets with statistical rigor and publication-quality outputs.

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis and implementation of [brief description of your project, e.g., a machine learning model, data analysis, or experimental study]. The work is conducted in a Google Colab notebook and is aimed at [state the purpose: e.g., exploring patterns in data, benchmarking algorithms, demonstrating a novel approach].

This repository contains:
- The main Colab notebook (`Student_Performance_EDA_Pipeline.ipynb`) with full analysis.
- Supporting files, if any (datasets, images, etc.).
- Documentation for reproducing results.
